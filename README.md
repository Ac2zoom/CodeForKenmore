# Code for Kenmore: CEDR (Community Economic Development Roundtable)

The purpose of this app is to provide a template for map display of open data for community roundtables in cities like Kenmore, WA

This application was developed on September 26th, 2015 for the [Code for Kenmore](http://codeforkenmore.eventbrite.com/).

Our app is not live.

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for [Challenge #1: Build an app that makes it easier for businesses to locate in Kenmore](http://example.com/this-also-goes-nowhere).

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Consider Open Data
- Build an Appropriate Display
- Consider its impact on the community

Once we did that, we knew we were guaranteed to win!
